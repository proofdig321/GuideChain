# GuideChain Implementation Plan - 08/19/2025

## 📋 Project Rules & Principles
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **No duplicate code** or redundant files
- **Web3 data priority** over Sanity CMS for business logic
- **No mock/sample data** - all data must be real or blockchain-sourced
- **Comprehensive testing** at each phase
- **Robust error handling** throughout
- **Enhancement-only approach** - build upon existing foundations
- **Maintain Web3 principles** - decentralization, transparency, user ownership

## 🔗 Key Integrations

### Smart Contracts (thirdweb)
- **GuideRegistry**: SBT for verified guides
- **BookingEscrow**: USDC payment handling
- **ReputationSystem**: Review anchoring
- **GovernanceToken**: DAO voting rights

### External Services
- **IPFS**: Document and metadata storage
- **The Graph**: Blockchain event indexing
- **Sanity**: Marketing content management
- **Vercel**: Hosting and edge functions

## 📊 Success Metrics

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Smart contract bugs**: Use thirdweb audited templates
- **Gas fee spikes**: Deploy on Polygon zkEVM
- **IPFS reliability**: Implement redundant storage
- **Wallet connection issues**: Multiple wallet support

### Business Risks
- **Regulatory compliance**: Built-in SA tourism law compliance
- **User adoption**: Comprehensive onboarding flow
- **Guide verification**: Manual admin review process
- **Payment disputes**: Automated escrow with DAO governance

## 💰 Budget Considerations

### Free Tier Limits
- **thirdweb**: 1GB storage, 1000 users
- **Vercel**: Hobby plan limitations
- **The Graph**: Hosted service queries
- **IPFS**: web3.storage free tier

### Scaling Plan
- Monitor usage metrics
- Upgrade to paid tiers when approaching limits
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize contract interactions

## 📝 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Clone template repository**
2. **Set up development environment**
3. **Deploy initial smart contracts**
4. **Create project structure**
5. **Begin guide verification UI**
