## üõ°Ô∏è South African Compliance Integration

### Guide Verification Requirements (Based on SATSA & SA Tourism Law)

#### 1. Provincial Tourist Guide Registration
Tourist guides must be trained by accredited training providers and registration must be renewed every 2 years. Registered guides are issued with identity cards and badges which must be worn at all times when conducting tours.

**Smart Contract Implementation:**
```solidity
struct GuideCredentials {
    string provincialRegNumber;    // Provincial registrar ID
    uint256 registrationExpiry;    // Unix timestamp
    string firstAidCertHash;       // IPFS hash of certificate
    string qualificationHash;      // IPFS hash of training cert
    bool isActive;
}
```

#### 2. SATSA Membership (Optional Premium Tier)
Each Member must be financially stable and display the highest levels of integrity, as determined by the SATSA Code of Conduct.

**Benefits in App:**
- "SATSA Verified" badge
- Higher booking limits
- Premium placement in search results
- Access to exclusive experiences

#### 3. First Aid Certification
Prospective Tour Guides must have an up-to-date tour guide card and a valid first aid certificate. They must also adhere to a code of conduct and ethics.
