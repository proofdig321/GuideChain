# Client-Side Exception Fixes - August 22, 2025

## 🎯 Issue Summary
Fixed client-side exceptions in `/contact` and `/guides` pages caused by attempting to call smart contract functions when contracts are not yet deployed.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The application was trying to interact with smart contracts using placeholder addresses (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`), causing contract call failures and client-side exceptions.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Mock Data System
**File**: `/src/lib/contracts/mockData.ts`
- Created comprehensive mock data for development
- 24 realistic guide profiles with South African locations
- Mock platform statistics, bookings, reviews, and applications
- Proper TypeScript interfaces matching production data

### 2. Contract Function Updates
**File**: `/src/lib/contracts/index.ts`
- Added contract deployment detection
- Graceful fallback to mock data when contracts not deployed
- All read functions now check deployment status
- Write functions throw informative errors when contracts unavailable

### 3. Hook Updates
**File**: `/src/hooks/useGuides.ts`
- Updated to use mock data when contracts not deployed
- Maintains same interface for seamless transition
- Added deployment status checking

### 4. User Interface Enhancements
**Files**: 
- `/src/components/ui/MockDataBanner.tsx` (new)
- Updated all page components

**Features**:
- Visual indicator when using mock data
- Clear messaging about development status
- Non-intrusive banner design

### 5. Page-Level Fixes
**Updated Files**:
- `/src/app/contact/ContactContent.tsx`
- `/src/app/guides/GuidesContent.tsx`
- `/src/app/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx`
- `/src/app/verify/VerifyContent.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added mock data banners
- Maintained full functionality
- No breaking changes to existing features

## 🔄 Deployment Transition

### Current State (Development)
```typescript
// Contracts not deployed
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.GUIDE_REGISTRY === "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
// Result: Uses mock data with banner notification
```

### Future State (Production)
```typescript
// Contracts deployed
CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.GUIDE_REGISTRY === "0x[actual_contract_address]"
// Result: Automatically switches to live blockchain data
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. ✅ All pages functional with mock data
2. ✅ Development and testing can continue
3. ✅ UI/UX refinements possible
4. ✅ Feature development unblocked

### Contract Deployment (When Ready)
1. Deploy smart contracts to Polygon zkEVM testnet
2. Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` in `/src/constants/index.ts`
3. Mock data banner automatically disappears
4. Live blockchain data flows seamlessly

### CMS Integration (Later Phase)
- Sanity CMS integration planned for final phase
- Current mock data structure compatible
- Easy migration path established

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Contract calls wrapped in try-catch
- Fallback to mock data on any failure
- User-friendly error messages
- No application crashes
