# Contact Page Context - August 22, 2025

## Current Status
Contact page icons have been fixed to use minimal sizing (w-4 h-4) matching other pages, but may need further refinement.

## Recent Changes
- Replaced oversized icon containers with minimal SVG icons
- Simplified contact information layout
- Used emoji icons for quick links matching header style
- Removed excessive gradient backgrounds and large containers

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/contact/ContactContent.tsx` - Main contact page component
- Build successful: 69s compilation, 115kB bundle

## Potential Issues to Address
1. Icon sizing consistency across all sections
2. Form styling alignment with other pages
3. Mobile responsiveness optimization
4. Visual hierarchy improvements
5. Accessibility compliance

## Reference Files for Consistency
- `/src/components/ui/Header.tsx` - Icon sizing patterns (w-4 h-4, w-5 h-5)
- `/src/app/verify/VerifyContent.tsx` - Form styling patterns
- `/src/app/guides/GuidesContent.tsx` - Page layout patterns

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript: 100% compliance
✅ Bundle: 115kB optimized
✅ Deployment: Pushed to GitHub main branch

## Next Steps
Review contact page against design system and fix any remaining inconsistencies with minimal code changes.
