# GuideChain Build Error Fixed - 08/20/2025

## ✅ BUILD ERROR RESOLVED

### Issue Identified
**Error**: `TypeError: i.createContext is not a function`

2. **Dynamic Imports**: Added dynamic import for BookingForm component with SSR disabled
3. **Client-Side Guards**: Enhanced mounting protection for all thirdweb hooks
4. **Conditional Hook Usage**: Prevented hooks from running during SSR

### Files Modified
